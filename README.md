# SQL
SQL statements I created in summer of 2016. Database design

In this code, I implemented concepts for working with relational database and SQL, I mostly used MySQL Workbench 
to work with MySQL database. I used SQL statement critical for everyday use, retrieve data from database, insert,
update and delete data. I worked with Joins, Summery queries, sub-queries, data types and functions.  
I designed and created database, used EER (enhanced entity-relationship) model and its related diagrams. Used foreign keys,
indexes and Views to maintain data integrity. I created Stored Procedure , worked with database Transaction  and created 
Triggers and Events. I learn t about database administration, monitor, configure, secure and how to back up and store a 
database.
